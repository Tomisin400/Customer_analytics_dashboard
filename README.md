## Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive **Customer Analytics Dashboard** built in Microsoft Excel. The goal is to analyze customer behavior, identify churn risks, understand revenue performance, and uncover actionable insights across 10 global markets (Brazil, USA, India, Germany, Australia, Canada, China, France, Japan, and UK). The dashboard is designed to help businesses make data-driven decisions around customer retention, loyalty, and engagement strategies.



## ❗️ Problem Statement

Over 60% of customers are either at medium or high churn risk,
yet the business has no clear visibility into who is leaving, why they are leaving,
and which markets, age groups or categories are most affected.

Revenue is being generated — but it is not being protected.

Customers are being acquired — but they are not being retained.

Email campaigns are running — but they are not driving loyalty.

This dashboard was built to answer the questions the business has been avoiding:
Who are we losing? Where are we losing them? And what do we do about it ?



## 📂 Data Source
The dataset used in this project was sourced from **Kaggle**. It contains 5,000 customer records across 10 global markets with the following fields:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| Customer ID | Unique identifier for each customer |
| Age | Customer age |
| Age Range | Categorized age group |
| Gender | Customer gender |
| Country | Country of residence |
| Average Order Value | Average spend per order |
| Total Orders | Total number of orders placed |
| Revenue | Total revenue generated by the customer |
| Last Purchase | Date of last purchase |
| Is Fraudulent | Whether the customer has fraudulent activity |
| Preferred Category | Customer's preferred product category |
| Email Open Rate | Rate at which customer opens emails |
| Email Engagement | Level of email engagement |
| Customer Since | Date the customer joined |
| Customer Tenure | How long the customer has been active |
| Loyalty Score | Numerical loyalty score |
| Loyalty Level | Categorized loyalty tier |
| Churn Risk | Numerical churn risk score |
| Churn Risk Category | Categorized churn risk (Low, Medium, High) |



## Data Cleaning & Preparation
All data cleaning was performed **manually in Microsoft Excel** without the use of Power Query.

### Steps Taken:

**1. Initial Assessment**
-  **5,000 data rows** were available for analysis.
  
**2. Missing Values**
Missing values were identified across several key columns:
- **Average Order Value** — many records had missing values
- **Total Orders** — some records had missing values
-  **Last Purchase** — some records had missing values
  
Notably, some records had **Total Orders but no Average Order Value**, and some had  **Average Order Value but no Last purchase** — both logically inconsistent and indicate data quality issues.

**3. Validation & Flagging**

A **helper validation column** named *"Column Issue Flagged"* was created to identify and tag all inconsistent and blank records. Rather than deleting these rows, they were **flagged and filtered out** during all Pivot Table calculations, KPI computations, and chart creation to ensure analytical accuracy.

**4. Helper Columns & Formulas**

**Revenue**
```Excel
=[@[total_orders]]*[@[avg_order_value]]
```
**Email Engagement**
```Excel
=IF(L2<=20,"Low",IF(L2<=50,"Medium","High"))
```

**Customer Tenure**
```Excel
=IF(YEAR([@[customer_since]])>=2023, "New",IF(YEAR([@[customer_since]])>=2021, "Medium", "Long term"))
```

**Loyalty Level**
```Excel
=IF(P2<=33,"Low",IF(P2<=66,"Medium","High"))
```

**Churn Risk Categories**
```Excel
=IF(R2<=0.2,"Low",IF(R2<=0.5,"Medium","High"))
```

## 💡 Insights At A Glance

| | |
|---|---|
| 💸 | Your biggest spenders are NOT your most frequent buyers |
| 📧 | Email engagement drives purchases — but it won't save a disloyal customer |
| ⚠️ | 1 in 2 customers is one bad experience away from leaving |
| 🌍 | Churn has no borders — every market is equally at risk |
| 🛒 | Electronics dominates — but it's also where fraud hides |

## 🚀 What I Recommend

| Priority | Action |
|---|---|
| 🔴 Urgent | Act on the 10.4% high-risk customers — they're leaving soon |
| 🟠 Important | Convert the 53.5% medium-risk customers before they slip away |
| 🟡 Strategic | Stop relying on loyalty scores alone — behaviour tells the real story |
| 🟢 Growth | Win younger customers (18-25) with social media and discounts |

## 🎯 Conclusion
This analysis reveals that customer churn is not driven by a single factor; age, loyalty, email engagement, and order frequency alone are not enough to predict or prevent it. With over half of the customer base sitting in the medium churn risk category, businesses cannot afford to wait. The data tells a clear story that retention must be proactive, personalized, and multi-dimensional.

Electronics remains the powerhouse category, fraud monitoring cannot be ignored, and no single market is safe from churn. Growth will only come from understanding customer behaviour deeply and acting on it, not from surface-level assumptions.

> *The best time to retain a customer is before they decide to leave.*
